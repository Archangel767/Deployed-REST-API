## Comments
- Running http://localhost:3000/gallery/ should call up the array and http://localhost:3000/gallery/Coast (or any of the array titles) should call up the requested item data.
- After watching many tutorials, I was finally able to get mongoose responding to data input, however on a very fundamental level, I can't seem to wrap my head around the programming interplay between node.js, express, heroku and mongoose.
